                    <h3>Roster Release</h3>
                        <blockquote>The roster is written 4-weeks at a time; I will aim to get it to you a month or so in advance, but sometimes due to factors beyond my control, it may be delayed.  If this is the case, I will let you know (and why)</blockquote>

                    <h3>Leave Availability</h3>
                        <blockquote>Generally, we can have 3FTE off at any one time, but there may be times when we can accommodate more.  </blockquote>
                        <cite>Registrar Roster Rules, Christina Alvino, December 2022</cite>
                        <blockquote>Being flexible with your dates and type of leave (ie: using some RDOs before) will increase the chance we can approve your leave, especially when there are multiple requests for any specific period.
                        (Note: you cannot use RDOs after AL - it's a payroll thing and they will continue to deduct AL until you return to work, I have no control over this!)

                        <blockquote>Priority for leave is given to PD leave and exam leave.  Study leave will be given but may not be immediately prior to an exam.  There will be block-out periods for recreational annual leave around exam time to allow for this.</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>Large chunks (i.e. 3 weeks or more) of leave need to be applied for no less than 3 months in advance, smaller periods can be asked for closer to the date.</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>Annual leave for a MPG employee will be granted by the employing authority and must be taken by the MPG employee before a further full year's entitlement to annual leave accrues.

                    <h3>Long Service Leave</h3>
                        <blockquote cite="https://www.safework.sa.gov.au/workers/wages-and-conditions/long-service-leave/requesting-leave">A worker should request to take long service leave as soon as practicable after they have become eligible. The worker does not have to give a set number of days&apos; notice; however, the worker should discuss with their employer a suitable time to take leave
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Any changes to this format of taking leave must be discussed between the worker and their employer and both must agree on the outcome. During this discussion, an employer and a worker may agree on:
                        <ul>
                            <li>the taking of long service leave in separate periods</li>
                            <li>the deferral of long service leave</li>
                            <li>the granting and taking of long service leave on less than 60 days&apos; notice</li>
                            <li>the taking of long service leave in anticipation of the entitlement to the leave accruing to the worker.</li>
                        </ul>
                        In the absence of an agreement, an employer should grant long service leave:
                        <ul>
                            <li>as soon as practicable after the worker becomes entitled to the leave, taking into consideration the needs of the business</li>
                            <li>in one continuous period
                            with at least 60 days&apos; notice to the worker of the date from which leave is to be taken.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote>An employer cannot deny the worker&apos;s request. However, an employer is entitled to take into consideration the operational requirements of the business when considering a worker&apos;s leave request and can negotiate alternative dates. It is not reasonable for an employer to continually deny a worker their long service leave entitlement due to 'operational requirements of the business'. Once a worker requests to take their long service leave entitlement, the employer should negotiate a date for the worker to commence their leave.</blockquote>
